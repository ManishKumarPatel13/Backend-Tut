# CORS or "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that 
# communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.

# OriginÂ¶
# An origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).
